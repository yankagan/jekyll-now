I'm conducting research in deep learning with applications to computer vision in the perceptual computing group @ Intel. There I work on probelms such as skeleton tracking, person detection, face recognition, etc. Before that, I did a post-doc at Duke University, where I conducted academic research in several different fields, including machine learning and computational imaging. Before that, I did my PhD at Tel-Aviv University, where I worked on solving wave propagation problems. This probably makes me one of the most inconsistent researchers out there. In my spare time, I like to learn as much as I can about artificial inteligence and machine learning and publicly communicate the things I've learned.
