title: About Me
---

I conduct research in the field of deep learning with applications to computer vision. 
I work in the perceptual computing group @ Intel, where I work on problems such as skeleton tracking, person detection, 
and face recognition. Before that, I did a post-doc at Duke University, where I conducted academic research in several 
different fields, including machine learning and computational imaging. Before that, I did my PhD at Tel-Aviv University, 
where I worked on electromagnetic wave theory. I like to learn as much as I can about artificial inteligence and machine 
learning and engage in pet projects, which I'm happy to share on Github.
